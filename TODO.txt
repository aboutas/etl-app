TODO 
Date: 24/01/2025  

- Create a test bucket with different JSON files.  
  (Consider using a Kafka topic later for real streaming data.)  

- Extend `transform_rules_manager.py` to support all **Order 1** rules  
  from `list_of_transformations.txt`.  

- Design a structure for managing both `transform_rules_manager.py`  
  and `schema_manager.py`.  
  (Potentially integrate with Kafka in a later phase.)  

- Implement a system for storing results in a database or another storage solution.
