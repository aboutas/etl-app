Some common Transformations are presented on the follow link : https://www.cdata.com/sync/about/etl-transformation.rst

A consolidated list of Transformations by category is given below

Marking 1: todo
        2: Trying to do,
        3: Maybe not implement
        4: Delete, exists in other transformation or doen't have meaning

•	Data Cleaning
   o	Handling Missing Values: Filling in missing data using default values, averages, or interpolation. 2
   o	Removing Duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate rows or records. 3
   o	Standardizing Formats: Converting inconsistent into a unified format. 1
   o	Error Correction: Fixing typographical errors or invalid entries. 4

•	Data Integration
   o	Combining Data: Merging data from multiple sources (e.g., databases or files) into a single unified format. 1 
   o	Deduplication: Ensuring that no redundant records exist after merging. 3

•	Data Aggregation
   o	Summarization: Creating summaries such as totals, averages, or counts. 1
   o	Grouping: Grouping data by specific fields and applying aggregate functions. 2

•	Data Filtering
   o	Row Filtering: Excluding rows that don't meet specific criteria (e.g., transactions over a certain threshold). 1
   o	Column Filtering: Dropping unnecessary or irrelevant columns. 1

•	Data Enrichment
   o	Adding Calculated Fields: Creating new columns based on calculations (e.g., profit = revenue - cost). 1
   o	Lookup and Reference: Adding information by referencing external datasets. (Usefull for duplication)

•	Data Standardization
   o	Renaming Columns: Renaming fields to meet naming conventions or improve clarity. 1
   o	Standardizing Units: Converting units to a consistent measure (e.g., converting all weights to kilograms). 1
   o	Capitalization Rules: Standardizing text formats (e.g., making all names uppercase). 1

•	Data Validation
   o	Range Checks: Ensuring numeric values fall within acceptable ranges. 1
   o	Domain Validation: Checking that values belong to a predefined set of acceptable options.
 1
•	Data Transformation
   o	Type Conversion: Changing data types (e.g., string to integer). 1
   o	Pivoting and Unpivoting: Converting rows to columns or vice versa for analytical compatibility.
   o	Normalization: Scaling data to fit within a specific range (e.g., 0–1). 1
   o	Denormalization: Flattening data structures to simplify querying or analysis. 1

•	Data Sorting
   o	Sorting Rows: Arranging records in ascending or descending order based on one or more fields. 2

•	Key Handling
   o	Primary Key Generation: Creating unique identifiers for rows. 3
   o	Foreign Key Mapping: Establishing relationships between datasets. 3
 
•	Geospatial Transformations
   o	Address Parsing: Breaking down an address into components like street, city, and postal code. 2
   o	Geocoding: Adding latitude and longitude coordinates to location data. 2

•	Text Manipulation
   o	Splitting or Joining Strings: Dividing a string into components or concatenating multiple strings. 1 
   o	Trimming: Removing leading or trailing spaces. 1
   o	Regex Operations: Using regular expressions to extract or manipulate text. 1

•	Time-Based Transformations
   o	Date Extraction: Extracting parts of dates (e.g., year, month). 1
   o	Time Series Alignment: Aggregating or interpolating time-series data for consistency. 4

•	Anonymization and Masking
   o	Data Masking: Replacing sensitive information with dummy data. 1
   o	Tokenization: Replacing sensitive data with unique identifiers. 1

•	Data Splitting
   o	Partitioning: Dividing data into segments for better management or analysis (e.g., splitting by region). 4

Each transformation addresses a specific need for making data actionable, clean, and efficient for downstream processes.
